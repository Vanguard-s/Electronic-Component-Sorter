  <b>Introducing the AI-Powered Electronic Component Sorter: The Ultimate in Intelligent Component Management.</b>
</p>

## 1. Description

The electronic component sorter is a project designed to automate the sorting of electronic components based on their characteristics such as resistance, capacitance, and inductance. This document serves as a guide for building and operating the sorter.

## 2. Features

- ** **

## 3. Usage

Change the paths for the models and the labels in the ```img_classf.py``` file and change the path of the output directory in the ```main.py``` file 



Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the application.
- **Step 1** Make sure the libraries that are present in the requirements.txt file are installed then run the ```main.py``` file after following instructions in [Usage](#heading3)
- **Step 2** A new window will be created where you can see the webcam press ```c``` to capture an image and process it or enter ```q``` to quit.
- **Step 3** An output will be shown indicating what specific component it is. 


## Important Points
- Refer to the ```requirements.txt``` file for additional information regarding the required libraries.


## Known Issues
- False classification of certain components 
    - **Status:** Issue being resolved 
    - **Cause:** Due to camera error. 

## Going Beyond
- Implementing a web interface using django.
- Implementing individual component value indexing and identification.
- Auto sorting using IoT
- Expanding to smd based components.
